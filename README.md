# Gtk Citation Program v1.3.0
## Copyright (C) 2022 Prokakis Emmanouil

This Citation Program, based on the Gtk toolkit and written in Python, aims to help the user format his/her citations in a more automated way. The program formats the data given by the user to a complete citation, ready to be pasted into school/university projects and academic papers!

The icons of the program are all made by Danae Lypiridi.

**Gtk Citation Program has been replaced by Qt Citation Program, which is superior in ease of use, features and stability. You can find Qt Citation Program at the official website of the application https://qt-citation.com/home. The github page of Qt Citation Program can be found here
